- title: How far in advance should I book my session?
  content: "recommend that women have their shoot date scheduled for about 2 months prior to needing the finished product in-hand. Also, being a one-woman show, I tend to book up very quickly and relatively far in advance. For weekday availability, you should email me to schedule at least a month and a half in advance. Fridays tend to be the most popular time slots and book up the quickest. That said, DON'T WAIT to email me! It's never to early to get on my schedule. Your photo reveal appointment will be approximately 2-3 weeks after your photo session, and your finished product (depending on what you order) will arrive between 2 and 4 weeks after that."
